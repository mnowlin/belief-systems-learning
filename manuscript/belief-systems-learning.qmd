**Abstract**: The Advocacy Coalition Framework centers belief systems, coalitions, and policy-oriented learning in its explanations of policy development. According to the ACF, belief systems are hierarchically tiered across three different types of beliefs, ranging from abstract and applicable to multiple policy subsystems to specific and relevant to particular policy instruments. Deep core beliefs are the most abstract, and they inform policy core beliefs that, in turn, inform secondary beliefs about specific policy approaches. Recent work has examined belief systems as networks, where beliefs are nodes and the correlations between beliefs are the edges. In a belief system network, the types of beliefs -- deep core, policy core, and secondary beliefs -- occupy various places in the network and perform various functions. For example, deep core beliefs may be high in betweenness centrality in the network, thereby providing a gatekeeping function for other beliefs, whereas secondary beliefs may be high in strength centrality, indicating that they are connected to the other types of beliefs. Within the ACF, policy-orientated learning is associated with change or reinforcement of beliefs; however, no work has examined policy learning in the context of belief system networks. In this paper, we pool several years (2006-2023) of public opinion data about nuclear energy to examine learning as changes in the configuration of belief system networks over time. Specifically, we develop a belief system network of nuclear energy that includes deep core beliefs (political ideology, environmental orientation, and concern about energy cost and availability), policy core beliefs (risks and benefits of nuclear energy), and secondary aspects (support for constructing more nuclear power plants). Then, we use network comparison tests to explore learning (i.e., changes in the network structure over time) in response to the Fukushima nuclear accident, a significant exogenous shock that likely altered the belief system network of nuclear energy.

# Introduction 

The Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) is one of the leading approaches to understanding the policymaking process. Since its inception, the focus of the ACF has been on belief systems, policy learning, and policy change [@sabatierAdvocacyCoalitionFramework1988; @sabatierPolicyChangeLearning1993; @sabatierAdvocacyCoalitionFramework1999]. In brief, the ACF posits that policy actors hold beliefs about policy issues and processes, and those beliefs are interconnected and form a belief system. Policy actors form coalitions based on shared beliefs and work together in coalitions to achieve policy goals. Often, policy change is a goal for one or more coalitions, and policy-oriented learning has been a central mechanism of policy change within the ACF [@jenkins-smithDynamicsPolicyOrientedLearning1993; @nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023]. Policy-oriented learning involves changes in beliefs within and across coalitions.   

Belief systems within the ACF are hierarchical, with three types of beliefs where the more abstract beliefs influence the less abstract beliefs. Deep core beliefs are the most abstract and influential, shaping beliefs across most policy issues and subsystems. Next are policy core beliefs that shape beliefs regarding specific policy subsystems and issues. Finally, secondary beliefs are the least abstract and involve beliefs about ways of achieving the goals of policy core beliefs. Related to beliefs are policy preferences, which are shaped by beliefs but expressed as support or opposition to specific policy instruments [@moysonCognitionPolicyChange2017; @plumerWhenDoesPolicy2024].      

As noted, within the ACF belief systems are understood as hierarchically structured. However, recent work has argued that belief systems can be understood as networks [@boutylineBeliefNetworkAnalysis2017; @brandtWhatCentralPolitical2019; @keskinturkOrganizationPoliticalBelief2022; @turner-zwinkelsBeliefSystemNetworks2022], including within the ACF [@nowlinBeliefSystemsNetworks2025]. A network approach to belief systems sees the beliefs as the nodes in the network and the connections between the nodes as the edges. Like other types of networks, the edges between the nodes create a system of interconnections, and within that system, some nodes are more central or influential than others. 

In this paper, we combine an understanding of belief systems as networks with policy-oriented learning. Specifically, we posit that policy-oriented learning involves changes in the structure of the belief system network. Such structure changes include the connections between the beliefs, the overall connectivity of the network, and the shifting centrality of various beliefs. We test this supposition using several years' worth of survey data of the US public regarding nuclear energy. The data was collected between 2008 and 2023, which allows us to examine the impact of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident on beliefs about the risks and benefits of nuclear energy and support for constructing new nuclear power plants in the US. 

# Belief System Networks 

Traditionally, within the ACF, belief systems are seen as hierarchical, with clearly delineated paths of influence or constraint between the various types of beliefs within the hierarchy. Constraint is a function of the interdependence of beliefs and means that one belief influences another in a way that keeps beliefs consistent. Within the belief system hierarchy, the more general beliefs constrain the more specific beliefs, with deep core beliefs constraining policy core beliefs and both deep and policy core beliefs constraining secondary beliefs.  

A belief system network approach to belief systems in the ACF doesn't rely on the type of belief and its position in the hierarchy to determine its influence; rather, it emphasizes its position in the network of beliefs. While the type of belief (deep core, policy core, secondary) remains important, a network approach uses the position of the belief in the network to examine the prominence of the belief. Specifically, the prominence of a belief within a belief system is measured by its centrality within the network.  
 
Centrality measures the prominence of the various nodes in the network, with nodes with higher degrees of centrality considered the most prominent and influential. The most used measures of centrality include degree, betweenness, and closeness, and each measure of centrality emphasizes a different aspect of the prominence of the nodes in the network [@lukeUserGuideNetwork2015]. Degree centrality is the number of connections a node has with other nodes in the network. The more connections a node has, the more prominent it is in the network. Related to degree centrality is strength centrality. Strength centrality is used in weighted networks, including belief system networks, and i the sum of the edge weights. Betweenness centrality is a measure of how often the node sits on the path between other nodes. Nodes high in betweenness are understood to be prominent because they likely act as gatekeepers of information between nodes. Finally, closeness centrality is where the prominence of a node is a function of how close that node is to other nodes in the network.

Several studies have illustrated the usefulness of conceptualizing belief systems as networks, and many have found that deep core and policy core beliefs play a central role in belief system networks. For example, using the American National Election Study (ANES), @boutylineBeliefNetworkAnalysis2017 found that self-reported political ideology, a deep core belief, occupies a central role in a network of other beliefs about various policy issues (e.g., abortion, environment, guns, death penalty, immigration, inequality, welfare spending). Additionally, using common measures of network centrality, including strength, closeness, and betweenness, @brandtWhatCentralPolitical2019 find that political ideology and partisanship are more central within belief system networks than operational (issues-based) beliefs. Exploring the issue of climate change, @leeClimateChangeBelief2024 found that concern about climate change, a policy core belief, was the belief most central in the belief system network. Finally, examining the climate change belief system network of the mass public, @nowlinBeliefSystemsNetworks2025 found that egalitarianism, a deep core belief, had the highest degree of betweenness and closeness centrality, and support for EPA regulations had the highest strength centrality. 


# Policy Oriented-Learning and Belief System Networks 

As noted, policy-oriented learning has long been a central focus of the ACF. The classic definition of policy-oriented learning states that learning involves "enduring alterations of thought or behavioral intentions that result from experience, and which are concerned with the attainment or revision of the precepts of the belief systems of individuals or of collectives" [@jenkins-smithDynamicsPolicyOrientedLearning1993, 42]. In the traditional formulation, learning involves changing beliefs within the hierarchical belief system. Yet, policy beliefs, especially deep core beliefs, are resistant to change, making learning less likely. Indeed, belief reinforcement tends to be more common than belief change [@weibleAdvocacyCoalitionsBeliefs2022].  

Building on the notion of belief system networks, we explore policy-oriented learning as changes in the network. These changes could include shifts in the overall structure of the network as well as changes in the centrality of various beliefs. To examine learning as changes in belief system networks, we rely on several years worth of public opinion in the US regarding nuclear energy. Specifically, we are able to examine the nuclear energy belief system by pooling the data across all years. In addition, we separate the data into pre-and-post Fukushima nuclear accident, which occurred in 2011, and estimate a pre-Fukushima nuclear energy belief system network and a post-Fukushima belief system network. We posit that the Fukushima accident was a significant enough information signal regarding the risks of nuclear energy to induce learning or changes in the nuclear energy belief system network.    

In the following analysis, we estimate the overall nuclear energy belief system network by pooling all the data from 2008 to 2023. Then, we estimate centrality measures, including betweenness, closeness, and strength (degree). Next, we estimate belief system networks and centrality measures for the period prior to Fukushima (2008-2011) and the period after Fukushima (2012-2023). Finally, we use network comparison tests to examine differences between the pre-and-post Fukushima networks, including differences in centrality measures. Significant differences between the pre-and-post-Fukushima belief system networks could be indicative of policy learning. 

# Data and Measures 

To estimate the nuclear energy belief system network, we draw on public opinion data collected annually between 2008 and 2023 from nationwide surveys of US residents.^[However, 2016 and 2017 are not included because of question wording changes.] In each survey, respondents were asked about their views on energy and environmental issues, including nuclear energy. The surveys were developed and administered by the Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis at the University of Oklahoma. The samples for each survey were recruited by firms including Survey Sampling International and Qualtrics, and quotas were used to ensure that the samples were representative of the US population. Overall, the combined surveys include `r nrow(beliefData)` respondents, with missing data removed. In the next section, we discuss the various survey measures used for deep core beliefs, policy core beliefs, and secondary beliefs associated with nuclear energy. 

## Beliefs 

### Deep Core Beliefs 

Deep core beliefs are foundational and serve as "fundamental normative values and ontological axioms, including the nature of human beings, norms for social justice, and the ordering of primary values (e.g., individual freedom and social equality)" [@nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023, 133]. Examples of deep core beliefs include political ideology and cultural worldviews, and deep core beliefs are applicable across all policy issues, act as filters for processing policy information, and shape more specific policy core and secondary beliefs. For deep core beliefs, we use a measure of self-reported political ideology, a measure of environmental orientation, and a measure of concern about the availability and cost of energy in the US. 

Among the US public, support for nuclear energy is polarized along ideological lines, with conservatives, on average, more supportive of nuclear energy than liberals [@hawesClimateSciencePolitics2022; @kuklinskiCitizenKnowledgeChoices1982; @besleyImpactAccidentAttention2014; @mcbethPoliticalIdeologyNuclear2023]. To measure political ideology, respondents were asked, "On a scale of political ideology, individuals can be arranged from strongly liberal to strongly conservative. Which of the following categories best describes your views?" with 1 indicating strongly liberal, 4 = middle of the road, and 7 = strongly conservative. The mean on the political ideology scale is `r round(mean(beliefData$ideology, na.rm = TRUE),3)`, which is the middle of the road.

The measure of environmental orientation combined and averaged two questions, one about the fragility of nature and the second about how threatened is the natural environment. Each question used a 0 to 10 scale, and the responses were combined and averaged. The two questions for environmental orientation were: 

> _On a scale from zero to ten, where zero means that nature/mother nature is robust and not easily damaged and ten means nature is fragile and easily damaged, how do you view nature?_ 

> _On a scale from zero to ten, where zero means the natural environment is not at all threatened and ten means the natural environment is on the brink of disaster, how do you assess the current state of the natural environment?_ 

The mean of the combined question is `r round(mean(beliefData$envt_oren, na.rm = TRUE),2)` on the 0 to 10 scale.

For energy worry, we used a measure of concern about the availability and cost of energy in the US. The specific question was: 

> _For each of the following issues, please rate your level of concern using a scale from zero to ten, where
zero means you are not at all concerned and ten means you are extremely concerned_ ... _The availability and cost of energy in the US?_

The mean on the energy worry measure was `r round(mean(beliefData$energyWorry),2)` on the 0 to 10 scale.

### Policy Core Beliefs 

Policy core beliefs are associated with beliefs about particular policy issues and subsystems. They include normative beliefs that reflect the values at issue in the subsystem as well as empirical beliefs associated with how the policy issue is defined along several dimensions, including the nature of the problem and its consequences. To measure policy core beliefs, we rely on a set of questions regarding the risks and benefits of nuclear energy. 

Respondents were asked to rate, on a zero to ten scale, their perceived risks of nuclear energy across four components of risk, including an accident at a nuclear power plant, an accident during transportation or storage of nuclear materials, a terrorist attack on a nuclear plant, and diversion of fuel to make a nuclear weapon. The exact question wording was as follows:  

> First we want to know about your beliefs concerning some of the possible risks associated with nuclear energy use in the U.S. Please consider both the likelihood of a nuclear event occurring and its potential consequences when evaluating the risk posed by each of the following on a scale from zero to ten, where zero means no risk and ten means extreme risk. [_Statements were presented in random order_]

* **nrsk1 (Plant Accident)**: An event at a U.S. nuclear power plant within the next 20 years that results in the release of large amounts of radiation

* **nrsk2 (Transportation Accident)**: An event during the transportation and temporary storage of spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants in the U.S. within the next 20 years that results in the release of large amounts of radiation 

* **nrsk3 (Terrorist Attack)**: A terrorist attack at a U.S. nuclear power plant within the next 20 years that results in the release of large amounts of radiation

* **nrsk4 (Weapon)**: The diversion of nuclear fuel from a nuclear power plant in the U.S. within the next 20 years for the purpose of building a nuclear weapon

Similarly, respondents were asked about the benefits of nuclear energy across four aspects: no greenhouse gases, a source of reliable power, contributions to US energy independence, and reduced damage to the environment compared to coal or oil and gas extraction. The questions included: 

> Next we want to know about your beliefs concerning some of the possible benefits associated with nuclear energy use in the U.S. Please evaluate each of these possible benefits of nuclear energy use on a scale from zero to ten, where zero means not at all beneficial and ten means extremely beneficial. [_Statements were presented in random order_]  

* **nben1 (No GHG)**: Reducing environmental threats because the generation of nuclear energy does not produce greenhouse gases that are believed to cause climate change 

* **nben2 (Reliable Power)**: Reliable power because nuclear energy generates large amounts of electricity and is not affected by weather conditions, such as low rainfall or no wind

* **nben3 (Energy Independence)**: Greater U.S. energy independence because nuclear energy production does not require oil or gas from foreign sources

* **nben4 (Reduced Environmental Damage)**: Reduced environmental damage because of less need for mining coal or extracting oil and gas 

### Secondary Beliefs 

Secondary beliefs are the narrowest and most specific beliefs and concern particular coalition strategies and/or policy instruments to achieve policy goals [@nohrstedtAdvocacyCoalitionFramework2023]. Secondary beliefs also inform specific policy preferences [@moysonCognitionPolicyChange2017; @plumerWhenDoesPolicy2024]. To measure secondary beliefs, we use a measure of support for building more nuclear power plants in the US. Specifically, we averaged responses on two questions, with one question regarding support for adding additional nuclear reactors at existing nuclear power plants and adding new reactors at new locations in the US.^[We do not have a measure of secondary beliefs, rather we assume that secondary beliefs are implied by policy preferences, which is support for more nuclear power plants.] 

> Using a scale from one to seven, where one means _strongly oppose_ and seven means _strongly support_, how do you feel about constructing additional nuclear reactors at the sites of existing nuclear power plants in the U.S.?

> Using the same scale from one to seven, where one means _strongly oppose_ and seven means _strongly support_, how do you feel about constructing additional nuclear power plants at new locations in the U.S.?

For analysis, we combine and average the two scales into a single one to seven measure of support for more nuclear energy plants. The average support for more nuclear plants is `r round(mean(beliefData$morePlants, na.rm = TRUE),3)`. 


## Analysis 

Analyzing a belief system network uses similar procedures as other types of networks such as social or informational. However, with a belief system network, the nodes are beliefs, and the edges are the connections between the beliefs. A common approach in belief system networks and other psychological networks is to use a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) [@epskampBriefReportEstimating2017]. In a GGM, the edges, or connections between beliefs, are partial correlation coefficients, which means that the edges represent the correlations between beliefs controlling for the other beliefs in the network. In addition, we use a "least absolute shrinkage and selection operator" (LASSO), which is commonly used in belief networks, to reduce small correlation coefficients to zero [@brandtWhatCentralPolitical2019; @friedmanSparseInverseCovariance2008; @epskampTutorialRegularizedPartial2018]. The following network estimates were generated using the `bootnet` and `qgraph` packages in `R` [@epskampQgraphNetworkVisualizations2012; @epskampBootnetBootstrapMethods2023; @epskampQgraphGraphPlotting2023]. 

In the following analysis, we estimate a belief system network that uses the full sample as well as a belief system network before the Fukushima accidents (2008-2011) and a network after Fukushima (2012-2023). We also examined betweenness, closeness, and strength centrality for the overall network and the pre-and-post Fukushima networks. To estimate the centrality measures, we used a bootstrapping procedure that used 1000 resamples of the data. The procedure was performed in `R` using the `bootnet` package [@epskampBootnetBootstrapMethods2023; @epskampTutorialRegularizedPartial2018]. The results of the bootstrap method show the estimated centrality as well as the 95% confidence interval for each measure. Finally, we performed a network comparison test to examine the differences between the nuclear energy belief system network pre- and post-Fukushima.

We first examine the overall nuclear energy belief system network for all years 2008-2023, pooled. The network includes deep core beliefs (political ideology, environmental orientation, and energy worry), policy core beliefs (the risks and benefits of nuclear energy), and secondary beliefs/policy preferences (support for more nuclear power plants). The nuclear energy belief network is shown in @fig-beliefNetNetwork. The deep core belief nodes are black, policy core belief nodes are gray, and secondary belief nodes are white. Additionally, positive partial correlations between nodes are solid lines, and negative partial correlations are dashed lines. Finally, the network is weighted, and the strength of the partial correlations is illustrated by the thickness of the edges (lines), with thicker paths illustrating stronger correlations.

groups <- factor(c(
  rep("Deep Core", 3), 
  rep("Policy Core", 8),
  rep("Secondary", 1)
))

groups <- factor(as.character(groups), levels = c("Deep Core", "Policy Core", "Secondary"))

plot(beliefNetNetwork, layout = "spring", groups=groups, negDashed = T, legend = F, label.cex = .8, label.scale = T, details = F, theme = "gray")

# summary(beliefNetNetwork)

# beliefNetNetwork$results$optnet


```

The network with the full sample has 12 nodes and 58 (of 66 possible) non-zero edges or connections. As shown in @fig-beliefNetNetwork, deep core beliefs tend to cluster together with ideology (increasing conservatism) strongly and negatively associated with environment orientation. Both ideology and environment orientation are weakly and positively correlated with energy worry. For the policy core beliefs, the risks of nuclear energy are clustered together with strong positive correlations, as are the benefits of nuclear energy. Additionally, the policy core beliefs are correlated with the secondary belief, with the risk measures negatively correlated with support for more plants and the benefit measures positively correlated.

betw_centO <- betw_cent %>% arrange(desc(mean))
close_centO <- close_cent %>% arrange(desc(mean))

```

Next, we examine the centrality measures, including betweenness, closeness, and strength, for the overall networks. As noted, we use a bootstrapping procedure with 1000 re-samples to generate the centrality estimates. The results are shown in @fig-cent.  


![Measures of Network Centrality (Full Sample)](centralPlots.png){#fig-cent} 


Looking first at betweenness centrality, as shown in @fig-cent, _nrsk1_, perceived risk of an accident at a nuclear power plant is the node with the highest betweenness centrality with `r round(betw_centO$mean[1], 2)`. Next is support for more nuclear power plants at `r round(betw_centO$mean[2], 2)`, followed by _nben2_, reliable electricity, at `r round(betw_centO$mean[3], 2)`. Nodes high in betweenness sit on the shortest path between the other nodes in the network and act as a bridge between other beliefs. Also shown in @fig-cent, support for more plants has the highest closeness centrality with `r round(close_centO$mean[1], 5)`, followed closely by _nrsk1_ at `r round(close_centO$mean[2], 5)`. Beliefs high in closeness are more closely connected to other nodes, so they have the shortest path to other nodes, which allows them to be influential in the network. Finally, looking at strength centrality, _nrsk1_ had the highest degree of strength centrality at `r round(str_centO$mean[1], 2)`, followed by _nrsk2_, a transportation accident, at `r round(str_centO$mean[2], 2)`. Strength centrality reflects the sum, using absolute values, of weighted connections. 


## Pre-and-Post Fukushima Belief Network Comparison 

In the next analysis, we compare the belief system network regarding nuclear energy before and after the Fukushima nuclear accident. As noted, policy learning would consist of changes in the belief system network, such as shifts in the overall structure, density, and/or shifts in the centrality of the nodes. First, we estimate and plot the belief system network pre-Fukushima, 2008-2011, and post-Fukushima, 2012-2023.^[Note that pre-Fukushima _n_-size is `r nrow(beliefDataPre)` and post-Fukushima _n_-size is `r nrow(beliefDataPost)`.] Next, we compare the means across policy core beliefs and secondary beliefs pre-and-post Fukushima. Then, we explore the various measures of centrality in the pre-and-post networks. Finally, we do a network comparison test between the pre-and-post-Fukushima networks to see if the two networks differ in structure or centrality.

The pre-and-post networks are shown in @fig-beliefNetNetworkPrePost. As before, deep core beliefs nodes are black, policy core beliefs are gray, and secondary beliefs are white. Additionally, positive correlations are indicated by solid lines, negative correlations by dashed lines, and the strength of the correlations is indicated by the thickness of the lines.

```

The pre-network has 12 edges and 54 non-zero connections, and the post-network has 12 nodes and 57 connections. The structure of the overall pre-Fukushima network is similar to the full sample network, with the deep core beliefs clustering together, the policy core beliefs clustering together (by risks and benefits), and the secondary belief on its own. For the post-Fukushima network, the structure is similar, except that _energyWorry_ is not clustered as closely with the other deep core beliefs.

: Comparison of Nuclear Energy Policy Core and Secondary Beliefs Pre-and-Post-Fukushima {#tbl-dims}

As shown in @tbl-dims, all the risk measures have a higher mean post-Fukushima at _p_<0.05, except for the terrorist attack measure at _p_<0.10. Along similar lines, all the benefit measures have lower means post-Fukushima at _p_<0.05. Finally, support for more plants declined significantly post-Fukushima.

Next, we examine the betweenness, closeness, and strength centrality for both networks, and the results are shown in @fig-pre and @fig-post. 

Looking first at betweenness centrality, as can be seen in @fig-pre, _nrsk1_ had the highest degree of betweenness centrality prior to Fukushima at `r round(betw_centOpre$mean[1], 2)`, followed closely by _morePlants_ at `r round(betw_centOpre$mean[2], 2)`. However, as shown in @fig-post, post-Fukushima _morePlants_ (`r round(betw_centOpost$mean[1], 2)`) had the highest betweenness centrality, followed closely by _nrsk1_ at `r round(betw_centOpost$mean[2], 2)`. For closeness centrality, _morePlants_ had the highest closeness score both pre-and-post Fukushima with `r round(close_centOpre$mean[1], 5)` before and `r round(close_centOpost$mean[1], 5)` after. Similarly, _nrsk1_ had the second-highest closeness score before and after Fukushima. Finally, for strength centrality, _nrsk1_ had the highest strength centrality pre-and-post Fukushima, at `r round(str_centOpre$mean[1], 2)` and `r round(str_centOpost$mean[1], 2)`, respectively. Overall, the ordering of beliefs seems to be similar across each measure of centrality. However, to know whether the networks differ significantly we employ several network comparison techniques.

Network Centrality Measures Pre-and-Post Fukushima
:::


To compare the pre-and-post Fukushima networks, we do a Network Comparison Test (NCT) using the `NetworkComparisonTest` package in `R` [@vanborkuloNetworkComparisonTestStatisticalComparison2023]. The NCT involves three steps: 1) estimating the networks using the observed data (see @fig-pre and @fig-post) and calculating the value of a test statistic, 2) create a "reference distribution" by pooling and randomly resampling the observed data, estimate the networks using the resampled data, and calculate a test statistic, and 3) evaluate the significance of the test statistics when the _p_-value, which "equals the proportion of resampled test statistics that is at least as extreme as the observed test statistic"  [@vanborkuloComparingNetworkStructures2023, 1275].  
 
Using NCT, we first perform an invariant network structure test, which examines whether the edges of the pre-and-post-Fukushima belief system networks are the same. This test uses an omnibus approach to test differences in all the edges in the pre-and-post-Fukushima networks. The null hypothesis is that all of the edges are equal across the two networks. The test statistic is _M_, or _maximum_, which "provides the largest value (in absolute terms) among each element of a vector" [@vanborkuloComparingNetworkStructures2023, 1277]. In this analysis, the vector contains the differences of the unique edge weights of the pre-and-post networks. The null hypothesis is that all the differences between the edge weights of the networks are 0. Based on the NCT analyses, there seem to be differences in the edges of the two networks since M = 0.0701, _p_ < 0.05. Therefore, some of the edge weights (i.e., the partial correlations between the nodes) are different across the two networks.   

<!-- and using Bonferroni-Holm correction -->
Given the significant _M_, we looked for which edges significantly differed between the two networks. Overall, we found five edges that were significantly different and in each case, the partial correlations were significantly _weaker_ in the post-Fukushima network as opposed to the pre-Fukushima network. These included edges _nrsk1_-_nrsk2_ (0.559 vs. 0.489), _ideology_-_nrsk3_ (0.130 vs. 0.080), _envt-oren_-_morePlants_ (-0.111 vs. -0.055), _nrsk1_-_morePlants_ (-0.169 vs. -0.114), and _nben2_-_morePlants_ (0.205 vs. 0.152). 

Next, we use NCT to test for invariant global strength, or overall level of connectivity, between the pre-and-post Fukushima networks. Global strength is the "weighted absolute sum of all edges in the network" [@vanborkuloComparingNetworkStructures2023, 1277], and the test statistic is _S_, which is the difference in global strength between the two networks. The null hypothesis is that the level of connectivity is equal in the two networks or that _S_ = 0. We found the global strength for the pre-Fukushima network is 5.751, and for the post-Fukushima network it is 5.647. This indicates that the post-network is less connected than the pre-Fukushima network; however, this difference is not statistically significant (_S_ = 0.104, _p_ = 0.115).

Finally, we examined differences in the three centrality measures across the two networks. As noted, the ordering of the centrality measures seems consistent; however, there may still be some differences. For betweenness centrality, there are no significant differences between the pre-and-post Fukushima networks. However, regarding closeness centrality, each node in the post-Fukushima network had significantly lower degrees of closeness centrality than the nodes in the pre-Fukushima network at _p_ < 0.05 (except _energyWorry_ at _p_ < 0.10). Finally, for strength centrality, six nodes had significant differences between the two networks. Four of those nodes saw a significant increase in strength centrality, including _envt-oren_, _nrsk1_, _nben2_ (at _p_ < 0.10), and _morePlants_, whereas two nodes saw a decrease in strength centrality, _nrsk4_ (at _p_ < 0.10) and _nben1_.  


# Discussion and Conclusion 

Belief systems and policy-oriented learning are two of the major theoretical components of the ACF. Traditionally, in the ACF, belief systems are considered to be structured hierarchically; however, recent work has posited that belief systems can also be conceptualized and measured as networks. In a belief system network, the beliefs are the nodes of the network, and connections between the beliefs are the edges. Specifically, the edges are the partial correlation coefficients between two beliefs. As with other types of networks, the importance of the various nodes is a function of their centrality in the network. 

In this paper, we built on previous work examining belief systems as networks with policy-oriented learning. Policy-oriented is associated with changes in beliefs, and we posited that learning can be understood as changes in the belief system network. To examine this proposition, we used several years of US public opinion data about nuclear energy to explore aggregate belief system networks and changes in the network after the Fukushima nuclear accident.

Overall, we found that the perceived risk of an accident at a nuclear power plant, perceived benefits of nuclear energy as a reliable power source, support for more plants, and perceived risk of a transportation or storage site accident as the more central beliefs in the network. Comparing belief system networks pre-and-post Fukushima, we found significant differences in the overall structure of the networks, with five edges (i.e., partial correlation coefficients) being significantly weaker post-Fukushima. However, we found no difference in the overall connectivity of the two networks. Finally, we found some differences in the node strength and closeness centrality measures, with four nodes increasing in strength and two nodes decreasing in strength post-Fukushima. Additionally, each node in the post-Fukushima network decreased in closeness centrality compared to the pre-Fukushima network. The differences in networks pre-and-post Fukushima point to policy-oriented learning understood as a change in belief system networks, in the aggregate. In particular, differences in network structure and centrality of various nodes point to changes in the belief system network following Fukushima. The changes in closeness centrality may be interpreted as changes in certainty associated with beliefs, which is a possible outcome of policy-oriented learning [@nowlinPolicyBeliefsBelief2024]. While preliminary, these findings suggest that a network approach is a way to conceptualize and measure belief systems, and those using a network comparison test can be a way to measure policy-oriented learning.
